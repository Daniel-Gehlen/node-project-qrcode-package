# Technical Report: Project Structure Creation Node Qrcode Package

**Requirements Met:**
1. **Directory Structure:**
   - The directory structure follows the proposed architecture, with well-organized directories for different project components.
   - Within the `src` directory, subdirectories were created for `prompts-schema` and `services`, suggesting a logical division between prompt schemas and services.
   - The `services` directory contains additional subdirectories for `password` and `qr-code`, indicating a clear separation between different types of services.

2. **JavaScript Files:**
   - The JavaScript files were implemented according to the proposed structure.
   - Within `prompts-schema`, `prompt-schema-main.js` and `prompt-schema-qrcode.js` files were created, suggesting the definition of different types of prompt schemas.
   - The `services` directory contains logic related to services, with subdirectories for `password` and `qr-code`.
   - Within `services/password`, `create.js` and `handle.js` files were implemented, indicating the logic for creating and handling passwords.
   - Also within `services/password`, a `utils` directory with a `permitted-characters.js` file was created, suggesting the definition of utilities related to passwords.
   - Similarly, within `services/qr-code`, `create.js` and `handle.js` files were implemented, indicating the logic for creating and handling QR codes.

**Conclusion:**
The project structure was created according to the specified requirements, with a logical organization of directories and JavaScript files. The implementation of JavaScript files reflects a modular and well-defined approach to different project components, such as prompt schemas and service logic. This provides a solid foundation for future project development, facilitating maintenance and the addition of new features.
